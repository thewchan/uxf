# Rust UXF Library

UXF is a plain text human readable optionally typed storage format. UXF may
serve as a convenient alternative to csv, ini, json, sqlite, toml, xml, or
yaml.

For details of the Uniform eXchange Format (UXF) supported by this library,
see the [UXF Overview](../README.md). ([Alternative link to UXF
